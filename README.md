#### Note:

- Kata: is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire.  I focus mainly on Javascript.

- Kyu: is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank on the platform.

- I've organized the completed katas and placed them into folders based on their kyu.
